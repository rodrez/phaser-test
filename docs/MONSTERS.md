## Stag

A stag will never directly engage anything, but if attacked it will defend itself, if only to allow the rest of its herd time to escape. When a stag defends itself it goes into a rage. When in a rage, the stag goes blind so when a group of stags perceive a threat, sometimes all of them react to the threat. Some have likened it to a stampede, and their behavior has certainly caused more than one such cataclysmic rush.

Stags, like Dire Wolves, are often found in packs. They are peaceful creatures and will sometimes flee if critically wounded, but be warned: if you attack one, you may have to deal with the whole herd. They often drop Leather, needed to build Flags.

## Dire Wolf

Men hate wolves because they are smart, they plan, and they hate us. Any tribal society knows that the wolves are their most dangerous enemy. Maybe the wolves simply want the land we take up, or the animals we kill, but, maybe they watched us make the dogs so many years ago, and simply refuse to forgive. A pack of wolves will actively hunt and attack lone creatures. Five can be expected to kill an unarmed man. Luckily, in this parallel world, the wolves have not yet learned that men tend to carry lengths of well honed steel.

Dire wolves are an easy kill if they are solitary, but they are often found in packs and are dangerous when it comes to large numbers. They will attack if you approach too closely, and they often flee when critically wounded.
