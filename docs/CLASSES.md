## Skill System Overview

You can access the Skills menu at any time by tapping "Menu" > "Skills" or just tap the blue Pages bar in the lower left corner of the display. The Skills menu will show you all the skills that you have learned so far. All skills (except for specialization classes) have 3 levels, and each level will cost 1 skill point each.

Once you have reached Level 10, Specialization Skill tracks will become available. You may only have one specialization skill path at a time. These specialization tracks allow you to optimize your character by achieving special bonuses related to the specialization track you choose.

## Classes

In Alternate Earth, your class is determined by the specialization skill track you choose. Each class has unique abilities, recommended equipment, and playstyles that make them distinct. You may only have one specialization (class) at a time, so choose wisely!
