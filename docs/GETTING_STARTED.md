# Getting Started

## Creating a New Account
If this is the first time you have ever played Parallel Kingdom, start the app and hit Make New Account. Enter your character's name and gender, password, and email address. You will also have to enter your age and choose if you want to have txt msg notifications sent to your phone. These notifications let you know when things are happening even when you are not playing Parallel Kingdom. If you don't choose text message notifications, you can go use the "Settings" button in the game to change your notification settings later.

## Your First Fight
Try tapping on items, monsters, and buildings around you for different actions you can do. Once you've explored around, try killing your first monster. Select a monster and select the Attack option. Your character should move towards the monster and start attacking it. A green circle in the top left of your character icon turns red to indicate you are aggressive. Keep an eye on your health in the lower right corner of the screen. Once you health drops below 50/100, move away (double tap) from the monster. If you have a Mourning Tree nearby, move towards it to start healing. Once you are healed again try fighting the monster again until one of you dies.

## Victory
If you won the fight, good job! You have defeated your first monster. You have probably noticed yellow "+X gold" bubbles over you character. As you probably guessed, that is the amount of gold that you got for killing the monster. There might also be an Item on the ground next to the where the monster was. Another thing you should notice is that the green circle that I mentioned earlier is still red from the fight. Don't worry, this will change soon, but while in this Aggressive state, your character is not allowed to do certain tasks like teleporting, planting, or building. You will be notified of this state if you try. Your health is probably lowered too, so you might want to heal up using a Mourning Tree or a Berry if you have one.

## Death
If you died, don't worry. You will re-spawn in about 15 seconds with full health. When you are first starting out, you will not lose anything for dying because you have beginner protection.

Beginner protection is removed permanently once you reach level 3 or your Effective Level reaches 4. Without beginner protection, upon death you'll lose:

3% of Pages Bar
Drop a backpack and all the items that you can't hold without it.
If you died to another player, you'll lose 5 max HP. You get back 1 max HP every hour.

## Other Things to Do
Oh wow, gold, items, monster killing!!! What else do you need? Well nothing, but we still offer so much more. With items that you collect from monsters and other sources, you can build buildings, place flags, or craft useful concoctions.

## In Game Help
In addition to reading the rest of the guide sections, there is also in-game help. You can access this as you go simply by selecting any item, monster or building and choosing the "Info" button.
